This is a small java program to shows the Goldbach's conjecture in action.
This conjecture, as you can see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture, proposes that all even number greater than 2 can be a result of the sum of two prime numbers.

Example:

  4 = 2 + 2
  8 = 7 + 1, 3 + 5
  22 = 3 + 19, 5 + 17, 11 + 11
